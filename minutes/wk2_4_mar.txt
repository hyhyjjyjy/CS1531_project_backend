Things we did:
    jordan was the main debugger and we help with him fixing all the errors.
    We went through our code and make the tests look more reasonable and more black-box.
    We temporarily turned Josh's fixtures into functions to ensure that tests are working as we currently are not too familiar with fixtures
    and we decided to let joshua turn the fixture back when hs is free on his own time.
    In our test file we changed the dictionary keys to match the exact output in the spec.
    We made a decision that we would have another meeting March 5th late night.
